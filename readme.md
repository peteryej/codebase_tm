Project: Codebase Time Machine

  Description: Navigate any codebase through time, understanding evolution of features and architectural decisions.

  Requirements:
  • Clone repo and analyze full git history
  • Build semantic understanding of code changes over time
  • Answer questions like "Why was this pattern introduced?" or "Show me how auth evolved"
  • Visualize code ownership and complexity trends
  • Link commits to business features/decisions

  - Choose simple solutions that can be run from a single machine
  - frontend should accept a github public repo link and provide a chat interface. 
  - Keep frontend UI simple and implement with static pages.
